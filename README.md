# experiment - a hub of notes related to javascript

hello, im starting to re-learn javascript from scratch. i'm typing every line of code to better help me, adding it to github to better understand github, and ultimately be a better web developer.

im taking notes while taking a free course at https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2 by Brian holt. He's a great teacher. I highly recommend this course if you want to learn js.

The javascript section offers a great way to quickly ramp up, and i also need to document it a specific way before I'm able to move forward.

This is a great place for new javascript developers to see sample code & could be beneficial for those who do not have a computer hand and eager to learn more about javascript.

javascript notes; creating notes to better help me comprehend, test, and debug javascript.
