// this is a simple way to learn while loop and variations of how to increment the loop

// set loop to zero
let loop = 0
// setting condition to <10
while (loop<10){
    // one variation of increasing loop count by 1
    //loop = loop +1
    // more compressed variation of increasing loop count by 1
    loop++
    // loog the "loop count" each loop
    console.log(loop)
